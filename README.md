- **Automatic mode**: The system operates as normal. TheÂ light colors are red, yellow, and green.
- **Manual mode**: A button is used to switch the light colors in this mode
- **Tuning mode**: This mode is used to modify the light timing length
- **[Pedestrian scramble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedestrian_scramble)**: when the button for pedestrian is pressed, its light is turned on and operates reversely to the light of vehicles
